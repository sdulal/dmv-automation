# dmv-automation
A program that finds the next closest time for written permit tests.

This program requires Python 3, the Selenium library and the Firefox browser.

The name and phone number must be supplied when running the program. For example,
```
python3 dmvAuto.py John Appleseed 1234567890
```

As of now, this program works for written permit tests, although its scope may expand to include other things (ex. driving tests) in the future.

Enjoy!
